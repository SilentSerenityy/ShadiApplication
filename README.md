Hey! I see you've found this repository housing my new project, or application! <br>
For the purposes of simplicity, and also because I don't have any ideas yet, I'll just call this **Shadi's Application**! <br><br>
What can you do with this? <br>
For now, you can simple stuff, yes lol. This includes: <br>
--> Calculator, add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers <br>
--> Random Number Generator, press a button, and let five random numbers output! <br>
--> Measurment conversion, convert units of measurement like feet, inches, centimeters, and yards! <br><br>
More will come, as I learn more about Visual Basic and what cool stuff I can make with it. <br>
But for now, you can just enjoy what I got here ðŸ˜„ <br><br>
